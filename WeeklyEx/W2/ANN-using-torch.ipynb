The dataset consists of 60,000 color images, with dimensions of 32Ã—32 pixels. It is divided into 50,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. With 10 classes in the dataset, ensure that your network has a softmax output layer comprising 10 neurons. When modifying the model's architecture or hyperparameters, conduct a search to identify an appropriate learning rate. Implement early stopping during training and employ the Nadam optimization algorithm.\n",

This involves standardizing the input features, initializing the network's weights using LeCun normal initialization (nn.init.kaiming_normal_), and ensuring that the DNN consists solely of dense layers. Observe the effects of utilizing SELU activation and self-normalization on the network's training stability and performance."
